## Why SwiftUI?

- Rich features
- Less code
- Incremental adoption

## Fundamentals of Views

- Basic building blocks of user interfaces
- Every pixel you see on screen defined by a view

- Declarative vs. imperative
- Compositional
- State-driven

## Built-in capability

- Supports dark mode
- Dynamic type
- SwiftUI Previews let you see stuff as you develop
- Adaptive quality - views display relevant to context - i.e. Button changing its apperance

## Across all platforms

- Build native apps for any Apple platform
- Multiplier on efforts - UI built for one platform is a good head-start for apps built for other platforms
- Common set of components across platforms, but also specialized APIs across platforms
- "Learn once, use anywhere" - not "write once, use anywhere"

## SDK interoperability

- SwiftUI comes with each platform's SDK
- Apps can pick-and-choose frameworks that provide compatibilities
- SwiftUI provides interoperability
- UIKit and AppKit are imperative, different patterns
- Use a view representable to use UI or NS views within SwiftUI
